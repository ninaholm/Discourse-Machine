How to make CST work in Linux:

Include the following directories on the same level:
- cstlemma
- hashmap
- letterfunc
- parsesgml
- rtfreader

Navigate to rtfreader/src and run one of the following:
	make 
	make rtfreader

This installs the application rtfreader somewhere. Use it from there or move it wherever you'd like.
You run it by typing:
	rtfreader -T -i [input file]

The tokenized file saves next to the input file.


Navigate to cstlemma/src and run one of the following:
	make 
	make cstlemma

You can now run:
	./cstlemma -L -f [flexrules file] -i [input file]

The lemmatised dictionary prints by default in the command line.
