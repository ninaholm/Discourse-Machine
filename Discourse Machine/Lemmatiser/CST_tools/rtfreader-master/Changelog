Version: 2.1 (2016.01.15)
-------------------------
Corrected interpretation of unicode characters \uN.
1) Absence of \ucM now means M == 1, as the RTF standard prescribes. Which
   means that we must assume that the unicode character is followed by a
   single character that figures as stand-in in case the unicode character
   cannot be handled.
2) Parsing \u51234anumber stops when the number after \u is as big as it can
   be in a short integer or when a non-digit is seen after having seen a
   number after \u
   
Version: 2.03 (2015.10.30)
--------------------------
More subtle improvements to segmentation.

Version: 2.02 (2015.10.28)
--------------------------
Lines with most words beginning with a capital letter are not always head
lines. The previous line must not seem to be unfinished: no punctuation,
comma or colon as last punctuation, hyphen as if word is wrapped.


Version: 2.0 (2015.10.13)
-------------------------
(Changelog starts here.)
Better handling of RTF coming from other sources than Microsoft s/w.
Better handling of periods and other punctuation.
Linebreaks in more appropriate places. (Because of previous point.)
Parsing of roman numbers.
Restructured the program: Still spagetti, but now with tomato sauce (more
source files, more classes).

Version 1.5
-----------
The previous version.
