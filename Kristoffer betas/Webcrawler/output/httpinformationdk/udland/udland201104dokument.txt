23. juli, 2008 INS TO USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN AFG Organization(s) Involved: AL QAIDA,TALIBAN,WAHIBI GROUP 23 JUL 2008, TF CASTLE INTSUM 4144, NSIG (SECRET//REL TO USA, GCTF, ISAF, NATO) PLANS OF MOHAMMAD HAMZAH AHMADZAI AND USTAD ASAD TO CONTINUE USE OF CHEMICALLY ENHANCED MUNITIONS IN AFG As of late june 2008, dr. Mohammad ((hamzah)) ahmadzai, an associate of tb commander abdul rahman ((habibzai)), planned to provide chemically-enhanced munitions to qari ((khalid)), a wahabi who sought to conduct unspecified attacks in konar province, afghanistan. Hamzah first met khalid in circa late may 2008 via ustad ((asad)), a chemical expert and hamzah's teacher. In early july, hamzah provided khalid two rocket-propelled grenade (rpg) rounds with chemical payloads that were intended to spread a poisonous gas upon impact. Due to his desire to continue acquiring such munitions, khalid had agreed to bring his operations in konar province under the command of habibzai. (comment: there was no further information on the timing or targets of any attacks khalid planned with the chemical munitions.) Separately, hamzah had expressed an interest in acquiring uranium to be used in explosives for unspecified purposes but found it to be too expensive to acquire. The uranium was allegedly available from an unspecified factory in lahore, punjab province, pakistan, at a cost of approximately 35,000 pakistani rupees (pkr) for ten grams. (comment: at an exchange rate of 65 pkr to u.s. $35,000 pkr is equivalent to approximately u.s. $538.) Hamzah was thus seeking alternative means of creating a large explosion that could be used to attack the cf base near the afghan military training center in kabul city, kabul province, afghanistan. Hamzah planned to use six kilograms of the same chemical compound he used in the chemical-laden rpg rounds. As of early july, hamzah had not finalized plans for such an attack. Hamzah originally obtained the poisonous chemical formula from ustad asad, who had been his teacher. Hamzah then implemented the use of the formula with rpg rounds. Asad learned his chemical skills from dr. ((salahuddin)), aka engineer ((salahuddin)), of punjab province, pakistan, who was located in iraq as of 2008. Salahuddin claimed to have learned his technical skills from pakistani nuclear scientist a.q. ((khan)). Asad claimed to have ties to numerous extremist groups, and he periodically brokered contact between hamzah and commanders seeking hamzah's expertise. As of early july, hamzah was attempting to make contact with unspecified al-qa'ida arabs via asad. An arab in bajaur agency, federally administered tribal areas (fata), pakistan, provided asad with remote controls for use with improvised explosive devices. Asad and hamzah were also assisted by ((rohullah)), who was the deputy for mohmand agency, fata, pakistan, for supai suhaba, a pakistani political party. Rohullah was in touch with habibzai via hamzah and asad, and he also claimed to be cooperating with tehrik-e.

2. maj 2008 HIG TO TARGET SCHOOL CHILDREN Organization(s) Involved: HEZB E ISLAMI GULBUDDIN20 MAY 08, ARSIC KABUL INTSUM , (NSI)The HiG is currently in the preparatory phases of a plan to infiltrate the schools of Kabul. The organization has been training women in the Shamshatu Refugee Camp, Pakistan - the women have reportedly completed training, and are en-route to Kabul. Upon reaching Kabul, the women will apply for a teaching position through the Ministry of Education, and due to the lack of teachers in Kabul, the women will most likely be hired. Once hired, the women will await for an opportune time to either conduct an IED attack, or poison the water supply in the school. Furthermore, the women have been instructed to target children of rich or Afghan government affiliated families, for kidnapping .
